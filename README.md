# TLS-Anvil

TLS-Anvil is a test suite for the evaluation of RFC compliance of Transport Layer Security (TLS) libraries using combinatorial testing (CT).

Have a look at our docs ([https://tls-anvil.com](https://tls-anvil.com)) to learn more about the project.

The test suite contains around 408 client and server tests for TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 based on the following RFCs:
* RFC 4492 - Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) Cipher Suites for Transport Layer Security (TLS)
* RFC 5246 - The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2
* RFC 6066 - Transport Layer Security (TLS) Extensions: Extension Definitions
* RFC 6176 - Prohibiting Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Version 2.0
* RFC 7366 - Encrypt-then-MAC for Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)
* RFC 7457 - Summarizing Known Attacks on Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram TLS (DTLS)
* RFC 7465 - Prohibiting RC4 Cipher Suites
* RFC 7507 - TLS Fallback Signaling Cipher Suite Value (SCSV) for Preventing Protocol Downgrade Attacks
* RFC 7568 - Deprecating Secure Sockets Layer Version 3.0
* RFC 7685 - A Transport Layer Security (TLS) ClientHello Padding Extension
* RFC 7919 - Negotiated Finite Field Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral Parameters for Transport Layer Security (TLS)
* RFC 8446 - The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.3
* RFC 8701 - Applying Generate Random Extensions And Sustain Extensibility (GREASE) to TLS Extensibility

## Project Structure

* TLS-Testsuite: Contains the test templates
* TLS-Test-Framework: Aggregator that combines coffee4j and implements JUnit extensions, annotations and the API for modeling tests for the TLS protocol
* Report-Analyzer: Standalone web application that facilitates the analysis of TLS-Anvil's output

## Build and Run

To build this project from scratch, we included all the dependencies as submodules and a `Dockerfile` that compiles everything in the correct order. You only need clone the repository and execute the `build.sh` script.

Alternatively you can use the prebuilt Docker image that is available as GitHub package.

```
docker run --rm -it ghcr.io/tls-attacker/tlsanvil -help
```

The foundation of TLS-Anvil was developed as part of the master's thesis *Development and Evaluation of a TLS-Testsuite* by Philipp Nieting at *Ruhr University Bochum* in cooperation with the *TÃœV Informationstechnik GmbH*.
