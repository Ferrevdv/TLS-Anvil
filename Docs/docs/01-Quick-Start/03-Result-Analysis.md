# Result Analysis

TLS-Anvil stores the test results in multiple `json` files. In addition the network traffic is captured with `tcpdump` during the execution. Since analyzing those files by hand is tedious, we created a small web application to get the job done.

The result analyzer application is also shipped as docker container. Since a database is required, `docker-compose` is the easiest way to start the application. The `docker-compose.yml` file is part our [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/tls-attacker/TLS-Anvil). Alternatively you can copy & paste it from here.

### Start the application

First we start the web application.

```bash
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
```

The application should be available at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

### Importing the results

Next the results need to be imported, i.e. importing the JSON files of TLS-Anvil into a MongoDB that is accessed by the backend of the web application. The uploader tool is also available as Docker image.

`cd` into any folder where child folders contain test results and run the uploader tool. It searches recursively for TLS-Anvil result reports and imports all of them into the database.

```bash
cd results
docker run \
    --rm \
    -it \
    --network host \
    -v $(pwd):/upload \
    ghcr.io/tls-attacker/tlsanvil-result-uploader:latest
```

### Using the application

1. Open your web browser at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
2. Click `Analyzer` in the navbar and select the uploaded report from the dropdown menu on the top left.
   * If the menu is empty, reload the page.
3. The result for each <Definition id="test template"/> is presented in the table.
4. The table rows are clickable and show the results for each <Definition id="test input"/>, i.e. each performed handshake.
   1. Click on a test result icon of a test case to view the recorded PCAP dump for the handshake as well as additional information about the handshake. `TlsParameterCombination`, for example, shows the <Definition id="test input"/> for the test case, generated by the combinatorial testing algorithm.
   2. Click on the table column head (first row) to see more information about the <Definition id="test template"/>, including the failure inducing combinations.

### Possible Test Results

**Strictly Succeeded (✅)**  
A strictly succeeded test means that the <Definition id="SUT" /> behaved exactly as expected. If multiple <Definition id="test cases"/> are performed during the execution of a <Definition id="test template"/>, the <Definition id="SUT" /> must have behaved correctly across all of them.

**Conceptually Succeeded (⚠️✅)**  
A conceptually succeeded test means that an implementation did not precisely fulfill the RFC requirements or did not do so in all <Definition id="test cases"/> but effectively behaved correctly. This usually applies to tests where a fatal alert was expected, but the library either only closed the connection but did not send an alert, or the alert description did not match the RFC's specification.

**Partially Failed (⚠️❌)**  
When multiple handshakes are performed for a <Definition id="test template"/>, the partially failed result indicates that not all <Definition id="test inputs" /> failed for a specific <Definition id="test template"/>.

**Fully Failed (❌)**  
A fully failed result means that the <Definition id="SUT" /> did not behave correctly for any <Definition id="test input"/>.

### Result Annotations

**Additional Information (❗️)**
In some cases, test templates highlight details that affected the result of a test. Tests with these details are indicated by an exclamation mark. When viewing the individual sessions of a test, the collected details are shown when hovering on a single result.

**Contradictory Additional information (⁉️)**
If a test template added additional details for the result but these details differ between individual test cases of the template, the test result is annotated with ' ⁉️ '. This may hint towards unexpected behavioral differences. In the result view, you can filter for results with specific additional information.
